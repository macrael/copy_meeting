x auth
	x read creds from config file

x make a service
	x copy to clipboard
	x play a sound
x BUG: I'm not the host and host key is wrong
	x had to make the meeting from my userid : POST users/macrae@truss/meeting instead of making it in the admin account
x change jwt expiration to 2 minutes
* read macrae@truss.works from somehwere
	* either put it in creds
		* this feels better. Hiding that we are really able to do whatever we want with these creds.
	* or pass it in as an arg
* run it outside of shell
	* maybe that's a little shell script that invokes the thing
	* creds live outside of /code
* error if creds isn't full
* error if anything fails
* might be nice to have a self-dismissing alert for visual communication of work
* instrructions for setting up
	* incoude you have to activate your "app"

Copy Meeting

a script, meant to be invoked as an OS X service that hits the zoom API, generates a meeting url, and copies it to the clipboard. 

UGH

the creds are admin creds
feels like I shouldn't have them
BUT if you go OAuth, the app needs to checkin every X minutes to refresh the jwt. lame.
